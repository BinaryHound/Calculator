# Calculator
This is my calculator project. It's a simple project to learn, create, and explore.

The calculator's current state is a simple one. Add, Subtract, Divide, and Multiplication are all functioning if your input is only one number.
Once the calculator receives a number like 12 it should be able to see it as a 'single' value instead of as two distinct number inputs.

Errors:
Logic: Multi-valued inputs are being seen as a single input value. Instead of 12 being a single value it is currently 1, 2. (urgent)
Visual: Output label is currently expanding in the wrong direction, and shouldn't be expanding all together. (not urgent)
